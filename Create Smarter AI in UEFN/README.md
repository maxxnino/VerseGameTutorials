**Heads up!**  
The code in this tutorial is something I’m still learning myself—both Verse and programming in general. So, while it works for this tutorial, it's more of a starting point than a polished final product.

It might not fit perfectly with what you're trying to do, and there could be some bugs here and there. Use it as a guide, experiment with it, and tweak it to suit your own needs.

If you’ve got ideas or want a specific feature, drop a comment on YouTube, hit me up on Discord, or add it to the issue tracker! I’ll try to cover it in future tutorials.
